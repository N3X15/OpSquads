They are experienced enough to know to \naim for the feet of their target, to not fire when the target is too close or when allies are in harm's way, and to adjust \nfor the drop and travel time of their rocket. They are fantastic at supporting/bombarding, but are ill-equipped to defend \nthemselves from close threats. Hold E to spawn with altered allegiances."
