ENT.Information		= "Four veteran members of an earth-based Combine Overwatch special forces unit. Heaily upgraded with Combine transhuman tech, \nthese troops are far better shots with firearms than the rest of the combine forces; they can hit their target, and they \ntend to aim for vital areas. These soldiers also are equipped with more advanced, heavier Combine body armor (including full helmets \nthat can actually do their job and deflect bullets). Their heavy upgrades also make them stronger in melee combat and able to move decently \nwith the added armor weight. With their upgraded minds and senses, these troops can spot targets at extreme distances and \nalways track down any enemy trying to evade them. Additionally, each individual has a system that repairs the body while not \nin combat, installed by the Combine. Hold E to spawn with altered allegiances."
