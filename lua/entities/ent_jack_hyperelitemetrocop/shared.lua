ENT.Information		= "This was the Combine's first attempt at a synth humanoid soldier. It was a Combine Overwatch trooper that was \ntaken apart and built as a cyborg. Over half the muscle mass in its body is synthetic muscle, and more than half the brain \nis computerized. It has lightning reflexes and the ability to shoot with extreme accuracy, and due to its strength it \nuses a powerful Combine pulse pistol (whose weight and recoil render it unusable in the hands of humans and Overwatch troops). \nThis soldier is hyper-aware, and the pulse pistol has a secondary fire mode which fires larger shots for engagin at \nlonger ranges. Hold E to spawn as friendly."
