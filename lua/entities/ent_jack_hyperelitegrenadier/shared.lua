ENT.Information		= "A veteran member of an earth-based Combine Overwatch special forces unit. Heaily upgraded with Combine transhuman tech, \nthis troop is far better shots with firearms than the rest of the combine forces; he can hit his target, and he \ntends to aim for vital areas. This soldier also is equipped with more advanced, heavier Combine body armor (including a full helmet \nthat can actually do its job and deflect bullets). His heavy upgrades also make him stronger in melee combat and able to move decently \nwith the added armor weight. With his upgraded minds and senses, this troop can spot targets at extreme distances and \nalways track down any enemy trying to evade them. Additionally, he has a system that repairs the body while not \nin combat, installed by the Combine. Hold E to spawn with altered allegiances."
