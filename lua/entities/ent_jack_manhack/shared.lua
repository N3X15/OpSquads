ENT.Information     = "One Jackarunda Industries Mk.1 Mod 0 Viscerator. This is a manhacks captured \nfrom the Combine and re-engineered for greater combat effectiveness. It is more compactly constructed with a frame \nof high-grade titanium instead of cheap mass-produced steel. It also has a significantly larger Combine dark-energy \npower core. Its razor-sharp blades spin much faster than that of normal hacks, allowing it to fly faster and dive \nharder into targets. It also has steel-backed carbide-ceramic armor slats for added protection. Its sophisticated, \naggressive J.I. software suite allows it to spot targets at over 5 kilometers, tear toward a target at breakneck \nspeed and dispatch it with ruthless efficiency. Every J.I. Viscerator shares information with others via onboard wireless \nnetwork hardware. Hold E while clicking to spawn as hostile."
