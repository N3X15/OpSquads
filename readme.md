Jackarunda's Opposition Squads
------------------------------

This is an authorized edit of [Jackarunda's Opposition Squads](http://facepunch.com/threads/1146683) that will both work on Garry's Mod 13, and also has some new features.

## New shit

* *Derma UI for editing spawners* - Gets rid of the 20 Questions routine when you're setting up spawners.
* *OpSquad NPCs are spawnable* - Makes GunHacks, Elites, and Rebels spawnable via the NPC spawner.
* *Bugfixes* - Most everything now works on GMod 13.
* *Console commands* - You can now bind a group of spawners to a key, or any other console action.

## Coming soon

* *Spawner Groups* - Toggle a group of spawners by name (e.g. "Combine", "Rebels", etc).
